This folder contains the data and code to reproduce the figures in the manuscript.

The `./figure*` directories contain the data and code to reproduce the named figures in the manuscript. Note that these are "raw" figures (i.e., without formatting for consistent style, etc.). 

The code required to conduct our simulations from scratch is in the `./simulations` directory. To run this code, you may need to modify it in your environment. At a minimum, file locations should be checked and modified as appropriate.

- Conducting large numbers of simulations will likely be prohibitively time consuming without access to a computing cluster. We assumed 26 cores for our production runs. However, small numbers of example simulations should run on a typical desk- or laptop with e.g. 4 cores without too much difficulty. 
- We assume R and a Bash shell.
